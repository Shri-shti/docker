# Running Docker Locally

Docker runs as a background service on server operating systems, but in a local environment the easiest option is Docker Desktop.

## Docker Desktop - Mac or Windows

If you're on macOS or Windows 10 Docker Desktop is the easiest way to get Kubernetes:

- [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

The download and install takes a few minutes. When it's done, run the _Docker_ app and you'll see the Docker whale logo in your taskbar (Windows) or menu bar (macOS).

> On Windows 10 the install may need a restart before you get here.

## **OR** Docker Engine - Linux

<details>
  <summary>Running Docker on Linux</summary>

Docker Engine is the background service which runs containers. You can install it - along with the Docker command line - for lots of different Linux distros:

 - [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

> If you're using WSL on Windows 10, it's much easier to use Docker Desktop which integrates with your WSL distro.

## Check your setup

When you have Docker running you should be able to run this command and get some output:

```
docker version
```

I'm using Docker Desktop on Windows and mine says:

> Your details may be different - that's fine. If you get errors then we need to look into it, because you'll need to have Docker running for all of the exercises.

> ‚ùó If you're running Docker Desktop on Windows, make sure you're in _Linux container mode_. This is the default mode, but if you've changed to using Windows containers (from the whale toolbar menu), then you'll need to switch back.
